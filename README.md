# Simple-Dice-Game
 This a simple dice game that can be played between two players.
 
 There are two dice on the page, one for the first player and another for the second player. Every time players click the button below, both 
 dice will generate a random number between 1-6. If the 1st dice generates a greater number than the 2nd dice then the 1st player will be 
 the winner else, if the 2nd dice generates a greater number than the 1st dice then the 2nd player will be the winner, in case both dice 
 generate a same number then that round will be draw.
